# Schools Analysis
There are a number of observable trends based on the data set
1. The schools with the highest math and reading scores and pass rates are all charter schools.
2. The worse performing schools (lowest passing rates) are all district schools with at least 2,900 students.
3. The math and reading scores stay pretty consistent by grade for each school.
4. The best performing school actually have smaller budgets per student ( less than $614/student), and have less total students (under 2,000).
5. Large schools (>4,000 students) have the strongest correlation with a low overall passing rate (56.6% for schools with > 4,000 students vs 90.6% for schools with 1,000 to 2,000 students and 90.1% for schools with < 1,000 students).
6. Students at charter schools are nearly 69% more likely to pass math and reading (scores >= 70) than students at district schools (90.6% overall pass rate for charter schools vs. 53.7% for district schools).
